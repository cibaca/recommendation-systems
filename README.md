<h1 align="center">Recommendation Systems</h1>

# Abstract

In this project, I have explored the algorithms and evaluation parameters utilized by popular recommendation systems, understand the purpose of using the specific algorithms for different type of dataset such as text reviews, rating-based recommendation system as well as ML agents and evaluate these parameters on different metrics. For this purpose, we can build recommendation system based on Machine learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning algorithms and evaluate them using metrics such as Predictive accuracy metrics, classification accuracy metrics, rank accuracy metrics, Accumulative reward, and non-accuracy measurements.

I would like this project to serve as a tutorial as well as a comparison survey to analyze how a particular recommendation system technique can be simulate based on the dataset and how to choose a metrics which would be appropriate to evaluate such models. Can we generalize any of these approaches?

# Introduction
Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognized examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders. These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services.

A recommendation system seeks to understand the user preferences with the objective of recommending him or her items. These systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, in parallel with the growth of internet retailers like Amazon, Netflix or Spotify. Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. In terms of business impact, according to a recent study from Wharton School, recommendation engines can cause a 25% lift in number of views and 35% lift in number of items purchased. So, it is worth to understand these systems.

Recommendation systems (RS) are omnipresent phenomenon which we encounter in our day-to-day life. Powering the modern-day e-commerce systems are gigantic ‘recommendation engines’, looking at each individual transactions, mapping customer profiles and using them to recommend personalized products and services.
